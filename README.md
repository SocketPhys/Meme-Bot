# Meme-Bot
A facebook bot which lets you create a meme from a URL and two Strings.

IMPORTANT: Set up the Npm module called "forever". It will allow this script to restart if it suddenly stops due to some error in the input parsing or json parsing.

You set this up on your computer and give your facebook credentials to the program. Then you run the program. It will allow you to connect to your computer from facbook chat. Credentials mean that in the bot.js , you need to input the facebook email and password for the bot. You can set it up with your own facebook account or you can make one for the bot.

All commands must start with /meme so that in a group chat the bot knows you are talking to it. Obviously, the bot must be added to the chat in order for everyone to use it.

An example of a  command: /meme "http://i.imgur.com/AtLeN.png" "You are mistaken." "This is my bowl."

This will insert the first string on top of the image, and the second on the bottom.
